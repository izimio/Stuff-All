# Stuff-All
Here are all the programs i make, without any optimization ! just a random stuff barely working but wich was pleasante to make 

Mainly and certainly only coded with the C language.

First, Here is a program that just write whatever you want after every '\n' inside a file. 
Inspired by the "Bot du Cul" which is bot that tweeted every french word by adding "du cul" at the end of it.

Secondly, i had the idea to recreate some of the included function in JS
I also add some of mine inside this huge lib that i'm creating. 99% of those functions are low IQ but as it was written above they were

"pleasante to make"

Thirdly the brand new program i made is a hang man ! It has all the feature possible !

Just choose the word you want your friend to find as the first argv !
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
or you can choose a playstyle where the program will generate a random word
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
and you can even play with a dict / just select the dictionnayr in the argv and it will select a random word inside of it
